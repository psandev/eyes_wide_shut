You need to create a conda virtual environment. It has to be conda due to two libraries, which cannot be installed in a pip environment: ffcv and xgboost-gpu.

If you do not have conda installed, I suggest you use miniconda, the conda slimmed-down version:
Go to the page below and follow instructions. It is a two-step process: download and install the bash script.

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html

The libraries installations  for both projects:
1. create and env and install ffcv and other libraries. This can take 10-20-30 min depending on your connection. Sorry.

conda create -n riverside_39 python=3.9 cupy pkg-config compilers libjpeg-turbo opencv pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.7 numba -c conda-forge -c nvidia -c pytorch && conda activate riverside_39 && conda update ffmpeg && pip install ffcv

PLEASE CHECK YOUR TORCH INSTALLATION IF IT IS CUDA COMPATIBLE.
On a terminal:
python
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available - if the answer is True, you are good to go.

2. conda activate riverside_39

3. Install xgboost

conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost-gpu



4. pip install -r the attached requests.txt file or just run the command below
pip install wcmatch matplotlib scikit-learn scipy opencv-python blurgenerator scikit-image kornia torch-dct optuna torchmetrics==0.7.3 pytorch-lightning loguru omegaconf timm tqdm wandb
